<h1>Distributed Systems Project</h1>
<p>
The project is a custom socket that implements a TLS handshake with RSA for communication between the
server and the client using JSSE. It also provides some sort of end-to-end encryption by
encrypting the data to be sent before sending it and the data is consequently decrypted
on the server side. 
</p>
<p>
Run the SSLServer to start the server.
Consequently run the com.ui.Main to run the client.
Run com.client.TestClient if you don't have javaFX.
